# Voice-First Navigation Concept

This page presents an experimental concept for a **voice-first navigation and guidance system**.

The core idea is simple:

- Do not assume users are looking at a screen  
- Prioritize listening, speaking, and confirmation  
- Support multilingual, hands-free, and inclusive navigation  

This repository focuses on **design philosophy and structure**, not implementation.

Status: Concept & exploration phase.
